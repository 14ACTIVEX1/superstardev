<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>To make a charcoal stove out of clay </p>
<h3>Objectives </h3>
<p>To find out how to make charcoal stoves out of clay
<br> :To make a charcoal stove out of clay 
<br> 
:To test on how we can make charcoal stoves out of clay </p>
<h3>Justification</h3>
<p>To use locally  available materials and make a charcoal stove<br>
To recognising the benefits of using locally made charcoal stoves<br> To use charcoal stoves to conserve the environment</p>

	<h2>Methedology</h2>
	<p>My project will take a period of more than one month to get the final product which is named a charcoal stove and it will heip the community in different ways including preservation of forests which are always cut down for firewood.<br> Some people used to pay alot of money to pay for electricity for the case of those who use it for cooking. Besides the importances, i will follow the following steps to come with  a final product<br>1. I bought the materials to use <br> 2. visited the swamps and collected clay to a suitable place. <br> 3. Covered the soil for the while to increase on it's quality.<br> 4. I will start making the stove using the modeling crate. <br>5. After making them i will put them on sun light to dry them. Then finary burn them .<br> I will make alot of charcoal stoves after a while in this project. Beside discouraging environmental pollution, i will also learn alot of income in this project </p>
