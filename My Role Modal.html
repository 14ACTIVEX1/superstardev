	<h2>Early life</h2> 
	<p>Walker was born on 24 August 1997 in Northampton, England. His father, Philip Alan Walker, is an Anglo-Scottish British and his mother, Hilde Omdal Walker, is a Norwegian.

Walker moved to Bergen, Norway at the age of two with his two siblings.[5] He knew little about music though he loved listening to it. As a result of that, he began watching YouTube tutorials where he learnt music and production.[5]</p>

<p>He was originally called "DJ Walkzz" and was part of several production collectives before becoming "Walkzz". The current logo consists of the initials "A" and "W" of Walker's real name, and was designed by Walker himself in 2013.[83] To project his image, he uses a hoodie and face mask similar to the Black Bloc concept.[84] Walker said: "At first we were thinking about ideas like how can we promote Alan Walker as an artist, but then we started creating symbols that anyone could do, and anyone with a hoodie and a face mask could do it. You can become a "Walker right away, and we are all equal, he explained his concept in an interview with KKBox.[85] In an interview with NRK, when asked why he used a mask, he said, "To maintain the image they gave me. Basically, I'm focused on anonymity, so no one knows. But I can join Alan Walker and show that masks can look good on anyone."[84]</p>

<h2>2016: "Sing Me to Sleep" and "Alone"</h2>
<p>On 27 February, Walker made his debut performance at the Winter X Games XIX in Oslo. He performed 15 tracks including the song "Faded" together with Iselin Solheim.[19][20] By March, Walker had produced 30 to 40 songs in total, but "Faded" marks his first single with Sony Music Sweden, and was considered the first to attain global success.[15] On 7 April, he teamed up with Zara Larsson at the Echo Awards in Germany, where they performed each other's songs "Faded" and "Never Forget You".[21] Four weeks previously, he achieved the first place on NRJ Euro Hot 30 for the first time, which only has been achieved by one other Norwegian artist, Kygo. <br>The single "Sing Me to Sleep" was released on 3 June 2016, and featured the same female vocalist Iselin Solheim as "Faded". The song topped the iTunes charts in seven countries.</p>

<p>
	Walker performed "End of Time" at X Games Norway on 6 March 2020. Four years after performing his hit "Faded" at the first X Games Norway in Oslo in 2016, Walker, K-391, and Ahrix performed the same at the Big Air Finals at X Games Norway.<br>
	On 15 May 2020, Walker released a remix of Hans Zimmer's "Time".[56] Walker had previously been gifted a signed copy of the score for "Time," and the two musicians first met in April 2019 in Barcelona during one of the dates of the "World of Hans Zimmer – A Symphonic Celebration" tour. This meeting led to talks about a possible collaboration, which finally saw the light of day. Walker said of the collaboration, "Everyone who knows me knows that I am a big Hans Zimmer fan. His work has played a huge role in my musical journey. Especially Time, which is my favorite song of all time. I am bowled over that my version of this song is the first ever official remix release of a Hans Zimmer work. I am so grateful for this opportunity!"
